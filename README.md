# A Gentzen-style monadic translation of Gödel’s System T
We introduce a syntactic translation of Gödel’s System T parametrized
by a weak notion of a monad, and prove a corresponding fundamental
theorem of logical relation. Our translation structurally corresponds
to Gentzen’s negative translation of classical logic. By instantiating
the monad and the base case of the logical relation, we reveal various
properties and structures of T-definable functionals such as
majorizability, continuity and bar recursion.
